//feature descriptors
1. SURF
gassusian filter to pixels around a point
#pos
good for rotation, blur cases
#cons
bad for perspective angle change and light change



//feature detector
1. FAST
detect corner, count continuous points that all greater or lower than the pixel value of the location
#pos
fast, good for rotation, percpective/image angle change
#cons
bad for blur, noises, missing detections, wrong detections, detection rate low in some cases, need adjust parameters
